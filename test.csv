Moreover, many existing schools lack essential facilities such as libraries, laboratories and workshops. In response, the country has begun a reform program to ensure that the educational system keeps pace with population growth and continues to develop and improve. This is to be accomplished by expanding, rehabilitating and refurnishing existing facilities, building new schools to replace rented quarters, and adding specialized learning facilities, such as libraries, to schools that need them.
